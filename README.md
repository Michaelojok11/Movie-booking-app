# Movie-booking-app
The Movie Seat Booking App is a simple web application that allows users to select seats 
for a movie screening and calculates the total price based on the selected seats and chosen movie.
Features: 
- Users of this application can choose a movie from the available options.
- Users can also select seats by clicking on them. Selected seats are visually highlighted.
- The total number of selected seats and the corresponding price are displayed.
This application has been built using the following technologies;
HTML - was utilised to help structure the content of the webpage, CSS- was used to style the user interface
for a visually appealing experience and Javascript was also used to add interactivity and functionality to the application.
Local Storage: has been used to store and retrieve selected seats and movie information.
This application was developed as a personal project and it was inspired when I went to the movies with my Fiancee.
